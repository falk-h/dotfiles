# This script is a fix for the fact that rustup does not ship a `rust-analyzer`
# symlink for some reason, even though it ships symlinks for cargo, rustc,
# rustfmt, etc. The script also installs rust-analyzer if it's not installed
# for the current toolchain.

if ! path=$(rustup which rust-analyzer); then
    rustup component add rust-analyzer
    path=$(rustup which rust-analyzer)
