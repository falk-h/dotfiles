# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Install with:

```sh
curl -sSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falk-h/dotfiles/main/.dotfiles-extra/{utils,init}.sh' | sh -s -
```

The script attempts to create backups of all files it overwrites in
`~/.dotfiles-backup`, but it's a bit broken right now. It's probably best to
make a manual backup just in case.
